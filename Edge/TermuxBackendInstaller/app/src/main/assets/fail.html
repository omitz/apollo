<h1>Hmm.. Something went wrong </h1>

<p>One of the installer script failed.  You can switch/navigate to the Termux screen to see the error message</a>

<ul>
  <li>Wifi is turned on.  Unlike Termux, Debian Linux hard-coded DNS to 8.8.8.8.   So make sure your wifi is not blocking 8.8.8.8</li>
  <li>typos/errors in the installer scripts</li>
</ul>
