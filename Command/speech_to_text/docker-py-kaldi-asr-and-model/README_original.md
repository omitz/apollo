# STT Service based on Kaldi ASR

This image contains a demo STT service based on
[Kaldi ASR](https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi) and
[py-kaldi-asr](https://github.com/gooofy/py-kaldi-asr). Try it out by following
these steps.

To start the STT service on your local machine, execute:

    $ docker pull quay.io/mpuels/docker-py-kaldi-asr-and-model:kaldi-generic-en-tdnn_sp-r20180815
    $ docker run --rm -p 127.0.0.1:8080:80/tcp quay.io/mpuels/docker-py-kaldi-asr-and-model:kaldi-generic-en-tdnn_sp-r20180815

To transfer an audio file for transcription to the service, in a second
terminal, execute:

    $ conda env create -f environment.yml
    $ source activate py-kaldi-asr-client
    $ ./asr_client.py asr.wav

For a list of available Kaldi models packaged in Docker containers, see

Docker images are named according to the format

    kaldi-generic-<LANG>-tdnn-<SIZE>-<RELEASEDATE>

1. `<LANG>`: There are models for English (`en`) and German (`de`).
2. `<SIZE>`: Kaldi models come in two sizes: `sp` (standard size) and `250` (
   smaller size, suitable for realtime decoding on Raspberry Pi).
3. `<RELEASEDATE>`: Usually, models released later are trained on more data and
   hence have a lower word error rate.

The image is part of [Zamia Speech](https://github.com/gooofy/zamia-speech).
