"In my opinion depending on discussions with the IMF and so on, yes why not ... We cannot say we don't have this option, and we cannot say this is the only option. But it is certainly an option, it is a good one," he said.

The powerful Hezbollah, which has previously said it was against allowing the IMF to manage the crisis in Lebanon, softened its position on Friday.

Its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said the group was not against foreign aid even it came from the IMF as long as the terms did not harm the national interest. During a June 17 speech eulogizing former Palestinian Islamic Jihad Secretary-General Ramadan Shalah and Hezbollah commander Hajj Abu Ali Farhat, Hassan Nasrallah called for a realignment with China in an attempt to end Lebanon’s dependence on western aid during its economic crises.

“I have information that is absolutely definite, if I am not sure about something, I wouldn’t talk about it. Chinese companies are ready to bring in money, and without any of the complications that we talk about in Lebanon. We don’t have to give them money, they will bring money into the country,” Nasrallah stated.

Nasrallah was referring to a series of letters sent by Chinese companies, including one by China Machinery Engineering Company (CMEC), to Lebanese Prime Minister Dr. Hassan Diab.

“As the government of Lebanon will be undertaking Beirut to Bekaa Express Way, Train and Tunnel project in Lebanon, we would like by this letter to express our serious interest to participate in said project as well as any other Railway and Infrastructure Projects,” the CMEC statement read.
