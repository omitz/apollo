"In my opinion depending on discussions with the IMF and so on, yes why not ... We cannot say we don't have this option, and we cannot say this is the only option. But it is certainly an option, it is a good one," he said.

The powerful Hezbollah, which has previously said it was against allowing the IMF to manage the crisis in Lebanon, softened its position on Friday.

Its leader, Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah, said the group was not against foreign aid even it came from the IMF as long as the terms did not harm the national interest.
